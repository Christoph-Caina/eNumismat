ToDo:

User Input Validation AddressBook
	-> Validate Names:
		-> No numbers ?
		-> Name1 + Surename should not have the same value / maybe also in combination with Name2 ?
		-> Check, if Name1 + Surename already exist in the Database ?
			-> if yes: what should be done?
				-> alterting the user "should the contact still be created ? Y/N"
		

	-> Import Contacts:
		-> Check cb_ for IsNullOrEmpty and if true to enable csv files with less columns than we have in our DB
		-> Check, if a combination of Name1 + Surename already exists in the Database.
			-> if yes: how should this be handled?
				-> is it possible to skip inserting for a specific row?
				-> is it possible to merge the Data with the existing data in the DB?
		-> Simplify the Column Check
			-> how ?
				-> check, if column names are LIKE the one we need in the DB and if yes assign automatically ?
					-> then we need to do something like fuzzy search for column names -> and it can only be done if the column name is not "Col_x"
		-> transform DATE into the expected format yyyy-mm-dd
		-> translate values like country and gender into english, like we expect this within the Database
			-> why?
				-> gender: we only check for "male" & "female" for displaying the image, even if we allow translated values in the combo box.
				   if we have now other values in the database, we can't select the right image when the contact will be shown
				-> country: this should prevent, that we will have the same country several times in the database... f.e. Deutschland, Germany, Allemagne, etc.pp.
				   --> But I can't translate EACH Country Name
				   --> should we use ISO standard names instead? DE, EN, FR, IN, etc. ?
				--> Then, we need to make sure, that we only have those values in our Database and not: Deutschland, England, France, India...
		-> Move DB Part into DBActions

	-> Export Contacts:
		-> provide a Form
			- where the user can select the Columns he want to export
			- where the user can select the Contacts he want to export
			- show a preview of the exported Data
		-> Create a valid CSV file...
			> default separator: ,
			> values should be in ""
			> other values like comma in the values should be escaped
			--> user should be able to select a nother separator like ; or \t
			--> is this allowed by the Export Class we are using?
